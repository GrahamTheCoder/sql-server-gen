# How to contribute

Pull requests are awesome, and I'd love to see more of them on this project.

# Guidelines

Create a fork, clone, submit pull request!  I'll try to review things as quickly as possible!

I try to follow the the [Haskell Style Guideline](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md).  Code should compile cleanly with no warnings with `-Wall` and cleanly pass the `hlint` (see http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/) inspections with no suggestions.

If you want to change/add major new functionality, then create an issue to discuss your idea and let's talk about it before you start to make sure it fits with any plans or open branches.
